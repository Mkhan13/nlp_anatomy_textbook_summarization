# Natural Langage Processing: Mental Health Sentiment Analysis
## Problem
Written text like journal entries or social media posts can reveal important information about a person's mental state. Early detection of mental health issues is the first step towards getting the necessary treatment and support. The goal of this project is to develop an AI model that can detect signs of mental health distress, like anxiety, depression, or stress, from text.

## Data Source
[Reddit Mental Health Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neelghoshal/reddit-mental-health-data)  
  
This dataset is sourced from subreddits concerned with mental health based conversations. The mental health concerns included in the dataset have the following mappings:  
  - 0 = Stress  
  - 1 = Depression
  - 2 = Bipolar disorder  
  - 3 = Personality disorder  
  - 4 = Anxiety

## Model Evaluation Process & Metric Selection   
- **Metrics:**  
  - 
- **Data Splits:**

All three approaches (naive, classical ML, and deep learning) are trained and evaluated on the same split. The results are compared directly against the naive baseline to quantify performance improvements.
