# Natural Langage Processing: Anatomy Textbook Summarization
## Problem
Medical textbooks are dense and terminology-heavy which can make it difficult for students to quickly understand and retain key information. Anatomy in particular requires detailed reading and repetition which can be time-consuming and overwhelming. This project uses natural language processing (NLP) to automatically summarize anatomy content into clear and concise summaries that are easier for students to review and understand.
